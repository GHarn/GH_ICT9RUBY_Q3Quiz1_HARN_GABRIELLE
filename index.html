He is the younger child and son of Qingheng-Jun and Madam Lan, the martial brother-in-law of Jiang Yanli and Jiang Cheng, and the son-in-law of Wei Changze and Cangse Sanren, as well as the martial nephew-in-law of Jiang Fengmian, Yanling Daoren, and Xiao Xingchen.</td>

			    <td>Lan Sizhui (蓝思追, Lán Sīzhuī) is a junior disciple of the Gusu Lan Clan.

Born Wen Yuan (温苑, Wēn Yuàn), Lan Sizhui is the last remaining blood descendant of the now-extinct Qishan Wen Clan. As a child, Wen Yuan and the rest of the Qishan Wen Clan remnants were sheltered by Wei Wuxian at the Burial Mounds, until the First Siege resulted in his family's massacre and Wei Wuxian's death.

Discovered by an injured Lan Wangji who came searching for Wei Wuxian's remains in the aftermath, the then-three-year-old boy fell into a high fever and lost all memories of his past. He was then adopted into the Gusu Lan Clan as Lan Yuan (蓝愿, Lán Yuàn) and given the courtesy name Sizhui.</td>

			    <td>Lan Jingyi (蓝景仪, Lán Jǐngyí) is a junior disciple of the Gusu Lan Clan. He often partners with Lan Sizhui. Lan Jingyi has a distinctly loud voice and boisterous personality. Lan Sizhui states that Lan Jingyi tends to be careless and straightforward: he is open and honest about his opinions. At the Burial Mounds, Lan Jingyi insists that the juniors have no choice but to follow Wei Wuxian as the one who rescued them, or stay with the Fierce Corpses.

Lan Jingyi is hot-tempered and quick to scold Wei Wuxian for his conduct, though he often disobeys the Gusu Lan Clan's rules himself with activities such as talking behind others' backs[5] and sneaking alcohol. Once Wei Wuxian comes to live in the Cloud Recesses Lan Jingyi continues to talk to Wei Wuxian despite Lan Qiren forbidding it. He also demonstrates emotional intelligence when he notices the closeness between Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji.

Wei Wuxian states that Lan Jingyi is the type of person who becomes completely enraptured in stories, a perfect audience member.</td>
